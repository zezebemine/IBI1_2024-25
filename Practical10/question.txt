question: How has the relationship between the DALYs in China and United States changed over time? Are the trend of change becoming more similar, less similar with the time going.
line number: from line 81 to line 140
discussion: Before seeing the results, I expected that the DALYs of China and USA would be the similar changing trend, which the DALYs decrease with the years increasing. However, starting from around 2008 
the DALYs of USA began increase slowly. But the DALYs of China keep decreasing. Around 1990 to 2008, the correlation coefficient is nearly to 1, it shows that during this period, the change trend of DALYs 
in China and USA has a strong postive linear correlation, and the change trends of the two are highly similar. However, around 2008 to 2019, The correlation coefficient drops sharply until it becomes negative 
and stabilises, which means that the change trend of DALYs in China and the United States has changed from a high degree of similarity to a great difference, and even a reverse change trend.
