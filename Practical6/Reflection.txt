I think this week practical is super difficult and challenging for me. I cannot finish the task just following the introductions, so I searched and learned some relevant functions and command. 
But, I enjoy the process to judege whether my command is logic or not and the process of learning new functions. When I saw the final result plot and amine, I think everying is worth it. 
I have learned the np.random.choice(), np.sum and array successfully. Maybe the most trouble me is the second task. I want to appear the eleven curves in one plot, but I am not familiar with using multiple for loops. 
Besides, I learned that I should to consider some special circumstances when programming. For example, in the second task, when vaccination rate equal 100%, the population of susceptible is negative. So I should to make the population of susceptible is 0, or it will bug. 
And doing the third task, considering the edge elements of the array is also necessary. So, considering some special elements or values is important.
