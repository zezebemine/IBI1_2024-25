Findings:
The length of human SOD2 protein: 222.
The subcellular localisation of human SOD2 protein: mitochondria.
The	range of percentage identities in the reported online BLAST results: 83.3% - 100%.
The	alignment score and percentage of identical amino acids for each of the three comparisons that you performed using Python:

Human vs Mouse:
alignemnt score: 1097
identical percentage: 90.09%

Human vs Random:
alignemnt score: -278
identical percentage: 2.25%

Mouse vs Random: 
alignment score: -276
identical percentage: 2.25%

In the three sequence, human SOD2 protein sequence and mouse SOD2 protein sequence have the closest relationship.

Interpretation: The human and mouse SOD2 sequences are most closely related, as expected from their evolutionary relationship. 
Comparisons with random sequences show significantly lower similarity, confirming the biological significance of the human-mouse alignment.
